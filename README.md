# DSA-based--self-projects

This repository consists of multiple projects developed with the goal of implementing and visualizing Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms concepts. Visualizing these algorithms helps in grasping the concepts in-depth and makes understanding even clearer.

## Projects

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe
Designed a C++ Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring a competitive AI, leveraging the minimax algorithm for strategic gameplay.

- **Algorithm**: Minimax Algorithm
- **Features**: 
  - Two-player mode
  - Player vs AI mode with an unbeatable AI

### 2. Sudoku Solver
Built a web application for solving Sudoku puzzles using the basics of HTML and JavaScript, implementing a backtracking algorithm to find solutions.

- **Algorithm**: Backtracking
- **Features**:
  - Input any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle
  - Visualize the solving process step-by-step
- **Live Demo**: [Sudoku Solver](https://adwait1609.github.io/Sudoku-Solver/)

### 3. NQueens Visualizer
Developed a web app for visualizing the N Queens problem, utilizing HTML and JavaScript along with the backtracking algorithm to place N queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

- **Algorithm**: Backtracking
- **Features**:
  - Visualize each step of placing queens
  - Supports different board sizes (N)
- **Live Demo**: [NQueens Visualizer](https://adwait1609.github.io/QueensNVisualiser/)

### 4. Tree Visualizers
Created comprehensive visualizers for various tree data structures and algorithms, facilitating intuitive understanding of complex tree structures.

- **Algorithms**:
  - Binary Tree Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
  - Binary Search Tree operations (Insertion, Deletion, Search)
  - AVL Tree rotations and balancing
  - Max Heaps operations (Insertion, Deletion, Heapify)
- **Features**:
  - Visualize tree structures and operations
  - Interactive interface for performing tree operations
- **Live Demo**: [Tree Visualizer](https://adwait1609.github.io/Visualiser-Tree-Structure/)

## About

These DSA-based projects were implemented by Adwait Vilas Kadam as self-projects to deepen the understanding of Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms. The visualizations provided in these projects aim to make learning these algorithms more intuitive and engaging.
